The People Analytics Starter Dataset is a sizable data set that includes information on more than 4000 fictitious workers of a sizable software company. It provides information on demographics, diversity, and departmental terminations. The simulation has been meticulously designed to guarantee that the data as closely approximates reality as feasible.
